# CONTRIBUTING

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the thoughtbot [code of conduct]
(CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Fork, then clone the repo:

git clone git@github.com:your-username/fflo-plugins.git

Make sure the tests pass:

npm test

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass again.

If your adding plug-ins that all come from one company consider putting them in a folder with your company name. If your adding as an individual and do not want to bother then add them in misc.

Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

Write documentation.
Write examples.
Write tests.
Write a good commit message.
